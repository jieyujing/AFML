10. The region of the optimal trading rule takes a characteristic rectangular
shape, as a result of combining a wide stop-loss range with a narrower profit-
taking range. Performance is highest across all experiments, with Sharpe ratios
of around 12.
Figure 13.6 Heat-map for 
In Figure 13.7 , we have increased the half-life from τ = 5 to τ = 10 . Now the
optimal performance is achieved at a profit-taking centered around 5, with
stop-losses that range between 7 and 10. The range of optimal profit-taking is
wider, while the range of optimal stop-losses narrows, shaping the former
rectangular area closer to a square. Again, a larger half-life brings the process
closer to a random walk, and therefore performance is now relatively lower
than before, with Sharpe ratios of around 9.

Figure 13.7 Heat-map for 
In Figure 13.8 , we have made τ = 25 . The optimal profit-taking is now
centered around 3, while the optimal stop-losses range between 9 and 10. The
previous squared area of optimal performance has given way to a semi-circle of
small profit-taking with large stop-loss thresholds. Again we see a deterioration
of performance, with Sharpe ratios of 2.7.

Figure 13.8 Heat-map for 
In Figure 13.9 , the half-life is raised to τ = 50 . As a result, the region of
optimal performance spreads, while Sharpe ratios continue to fall to 0.8. This is
the same effect we observed in the case of zero long-run equilibrium (Section
13.6.1), with the difference that because now 
 , there is no
symmetric area of worst performance.

Figure 13.9 Heat-map for 
In Figure 13.10 , we appreciate that τ = 100 leads to the natural conclusion of
the trend described above. The process is now so close to a random walk that
the maximum Sharpe ratio is a mere 0.32.

We can observe a similar pattern in Figures 13.11 through 13.15, where
 and τ is progressively increased from 5 to 10, 25, 50, and 100,
respectively.

13.6.3 Cases with Negative Long-Run Equilibrium
A rational market participant would not initiate a position under the assumption
that a loss is the expected outcome. However, if a trader recognizes that losses
are the expected outcome of a pre-existing position, she still needs a strategy to
stop-out that position while minimizing such losses.
We have obtained Figure 13.16 as a result of applying parameters
 . If we compare Figure 13.16 with Figure 13.6 , it
appears as if one is a rotated complementary of the other. Figure 13.6
resembles a rotated photographic negative of Figure 13.16 . The reason is that
the profit in Figure 13.6 is translated into a loss in Figure 13.16 , and the loss in
Figure 13.6 is translated into a profit in Figure 13.16 . One case is a reverse
image of the other, just as a gambler's loss is the house's gain.
