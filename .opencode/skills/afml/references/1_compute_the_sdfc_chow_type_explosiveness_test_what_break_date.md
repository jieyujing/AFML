# 1. Compute the SDFC (Chow-type) explosiveness test. What break date

1. Compute the SDFC (Chow-type) explosiveness test. What break date
does this method select? Is this what you expected?
2. Compute and plot the SADF values for this series. Do you observe
extreme spikes around the dot-com bubble and before the Great
Recession? Did the bursts also cause spikes?
3. 
Following on exercise 2,
1. Determine the periods where the series exhibited
1. Steady conditions
2. Unit-Root conditions
3. Explosive conditions
2. Compute QADF.
3. Compute CADF.
4. 
On a dollar bar series on E-mini S&P 500 futures,
1. Compute SMT for SM-Poly1 and SM-Poly 2, where φ = 1. What is
their correlation?
2. Compute SMT for SM-Exp, where φ = 1 and φ = 0.5. What is their
correlation?
3. Compute SMT for SM-Power, where φ = 1 and φ = 0.5. What is their
correlation?
5. 
If you compute the reciprocal of each price, the series { y − 1 
t }
turns bubbles into bursts and bursts into bubbles.
1. Is this transformation needed, to identify bursts?
2. What methods in this chapter can identify b
