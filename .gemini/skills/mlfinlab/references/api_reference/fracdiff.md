## Classes

### FractionalDifferentiation

FractionalDifferentiation class encapsulates the functions that can
be used to compute fractionally differentiated series.

**Inherits from**: (none)

#### Methods

##### get_weights(diff_amt, size)

Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Chapter 5, section 5.4.2, page 79.

The helper function generates weights that are used to compute fractionally
differentiated series. It computes the weights that get used in the computation
of  fractionally differentiated series. This generates a non-terminating series
that approaches zero asymptotically. The side effect of this function is that
it leads to negative drift "caused by an expanding window's added weights"
(see page 83 AFML)

When diff_amt is real (non-integer) positive number then it preserves memory.

The book does not discuss what should be expected if d is a negative real
number. Conceptually (from set theory) negative d leads to set of negative
number of elements. And that translates into a set whose elements can be
selected more than once or as many times as one chooses (multisets with
unbounded multiplicity) - see http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/msri-up12.pdf.

:param diff_amt: (float) Differencing amount
:param size: (int) Length of the series
:return: (np.ndarray) Weight vector

**Decorators**: `@staticmethod`

**Parameters**:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| diff_amt | None | - | - |
| size | None | - | - |


##### frac_diff(series, diff_amt, thresh = 0.01)

Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Chapter 5, section 5.5, page 82.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus

The steps are as follows:
- Compute weights (this is a one-time exercise)
- Iteratively apply the weights to the price series and generate output points

This is the expanding window variant of the fracDiff algorithm
Note 1: For thresh-1, nothing is skipped
Note 2: diff_amt can be any positive fractional, not necessarility bounded [0, 1]

:param series: (pd.DataFrame) A time series that needs to be differenced
:param diff_amt: (float) Differencing amount
:param thresh: (float) Threshold or epsilon
:return: (pd.DataFrame) Differenced series

**Decorators**: `@staticmethod`

**Parameters**:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| series | None | - | - |
| diff_amt | None | - | - |
| thresh | None | 0.01 | - |


##### get_weights_ffd(diff_amt, thresh, lim)

Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Chapter 5, section 5.4.2, page 83.

The helper function generates weights that are used to compute fractionally
differentiate dseries. It computes the weights that get used in the computation
of fractionally differentiated series. The series is of fixed width and same
weights (generated by this function) can be used when creating fractional
differentiated series.
This makes the process more efficient. But the side-effect is that the
fractionally differentiated series is skewed and has excess kurtosis. In
other words, it is not Gaussian any more.

The discussion of positive and negative d is similar to that in get_weights
(see the function get_weights)

:param diff_amt: (float) Differencing amount
:param thresh: (float) Threshold for minimum weight
:param lim: (int) Maximum length of the weight vector
:return: (np.ndarray) Weight vector

**Decorators**: `@staticmethod`

**Parameters**:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| diff_amt | None | - | - |
| thresh | None | - | - |
| lim | None | - | - |

The steps are as follows:

- Iteratively apply the weights to the price series and generate output points

Constant width window (new solution)
Note 1: thresh determines the cut-off weight for the window

This function plots the graph to find the minimum D value that passes the ADF test.

It allows to determine d - the amount of memory that needs to be removed to achieve
stationarity. This function covers the case of 0 < d << 1, when the original series is
"mildly non-stationary."

The right y-axis on the plot is the ADF statistic computed on the input series downsampled
to a daily frequency.

The x-axis displays the d value used to generate the series on which the ADF statistic is computed.

The left y-axis plots the correlation between the original series (d=0) and the differentiated
series at various d values.

Examples on how to interpret the results of this function are available in the corresponding part
in the book Advances in Financial Machine Learning.

:param series: (pd.DataFrame) Dataframe that contains a 'close' column with prices to use.
:return: (plt.AxesSubplot) A plot that can be displayed or used to obtain resulting data.

**Parameters**:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| series | None | - | - |

**Returns**: (none)
