4. What is the CV score of the optimal parameter combination? How
does it compare to the CV score from exercise 1?
3. 
From exercise 1,
1. Compute the Sharpe ratio of the resulting in-sample forecasts, from
point 1.a (see Chapter 14 for a definition of Sharpe ratio).
2. Repeat point 1.a, this time with accuracy as the scoring function.
Compute the in-sample forecasts derived from the hyper-tuned
parameters.
3. What scoring method leads to higher (in-sample) Sharpe ratio?
4. 
From exercise 2,
1. Compute the Sharpe ratio of the resulting in-sample forecasts, from
point 2.a.
2. Repeat point 2.a, this time with accuracy as the scoring function.
Compute the in-sample forecasts derived from the hyper-tuned
parameters.
3. What scoring method leads to higher (in-sample) Sharpe ratio?
5. 
Read the definition of log loss, L [ Y , P ].
1. Why is the scoring function neg_log_loss defined as the negative
log loss, − L [Y , P ]?
2. What would be the outcome of maximizing the log loss, rather than
th
