# 3. Plot the time series of the number of concurrent labels on the primary

3. Plot the time series of the number of concurrent labels on the primary
axis, and the time series of exponentially weighted moving standard
deviation of returns on the secondary axis.
4. Produce a scatterplot of the number of concurrent labels (x-axis) and
the exponentially weighted moving standard deviation of returns (y-
axis). Can you appreciate a relationship?
2. 
Using the function mpSampleTW , compute the average
uniqueness of each label. What is the first-order serial
correlation, AR(1), of this time series? Is it statistically
significant? Why?
3. 
Fit a random forest to a financial dataset where 
 .
1. What is the mean out-of-bag accuracy?
2. What is the mean accuracy of k-fold cross-validation (without
shuffling) on the same dataset?
3. Why is out-of-bag accuracy so much higher than cross-validation
accuracy? Which one is more correct / less biased? What is the
source of this bias?
4. 
Modify the code in Section 4.7 to apply an exponential time-
decay factor.
5. 
Consider y

Sample weighting is a common topic in the ML learning literature. However
the practical problems discussed in this chapter are characteristic of investment
applications, for which the academic literature is extremely scarce. Below are
