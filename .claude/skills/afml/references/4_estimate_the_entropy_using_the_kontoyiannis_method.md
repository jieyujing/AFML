4. Estimate the entropy using the Kontoyiannis method:
1. using a window size of 10.
2. using a window size of 100.
4. 
Using the draws from exercise 3, { x t } t = 1, …, 1000 :
1. Compute y t = ρy t − 1 + x t , where ρ = .5, y 0 = 0.
2. Label {y t } the observations according to 8 quantiles.
3. Estimate the entropy using the plug-in method.

5. 
Suppose a portfolio of 10 holdings with equal dollar allocations.
1. The portion of the total risk contributed by the i th principal
component is  , i = 1, …, 10. What is the portfolio's entropy?
2. The portion of the total risk contributed by the i th principal
component is 
 , i = 1, …, 10. What is the portfolio's entropy?
3. The portion of the total risk contributed by the i th principal
component is 
 , i = 1, …, 10, α ∈ [0, 1]. Plot
the portolio's entropy as a function of α.
