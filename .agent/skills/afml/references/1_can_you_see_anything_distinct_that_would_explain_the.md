1. Can you see anything distinct that would explain the
disagreement?
2. Are these disagreements associated with large price jumps? Or

3. Are these disagreements more likely to occur during periods of
high or low market activity?
2. 
Compute the Roll model on the time series of E-mini S&P 500
futures tick data.
1. What are the estimated values of σ 2 
u and c ?
2. Knowing that this contract is one of the most liquid products in the
world, and that it trades at the tightest possible bid-ask spread, are
these values in line with your expectations?
3. 
Compute the high-low volatility estimator ( Section19.3.3.) on
E-mini S&P 500 futures:
1. Using weekly values, how does this differ from the standard
deviation of close-to-close returns?
2. Using daily values, how does this differ from the standard deviation
of close-to-close returns?
3. Using dollar bars, for an average of 50 bars per day, how does this
differ from the standard deviation of clo

Compute a time series of daily quote cancellations rates, and the
portion of market orders, on the E-mini S&P 500 futures
