# 1. Following López de Prado and Peijan [2004] and López de Prado

1. Following López de Prado and Peijan [2004] and López de Prado
and Foreman [2014], derive the first four moments for the mixture's
returns.
2. What is the annualized SR?
3. Using those moments, compute PSR[1] (see Chapter 14). At a 95%
confidence level, would you discard this strategy?
4. 
Using Snippet 15.5, compute 
 for the strategy
described in exercise 3. At a significance level of 0.05, would
you discard this strategy? Is this result consistent with PSR
[θ*]?
5. 
In general, what result do you expect to be more accurate, PSR
[θ*] or 
 ? How are these two methods
complementary?
6. 
Re-examine the results from Chapter 13, in light of what you
have learned in this chapter.
1. Does the asymmetry between profit taking and stop-loss thresholds
in OTRs make sense?
2. What is the range of p implied by Figure 13.1, for a daily betting
frequency?
3. What is the range of p implied by Figure 13.5, for a weekly betting
frequency?
